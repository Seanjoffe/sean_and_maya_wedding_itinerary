# 💜 Sean & Maya’s Wedding Week Itinerary

Welcome, friends and family! 🎉  
This is your **official, always-up-to-date guide** to the week leading up to our wedding in beautiful Israel.

## 📅 What is This?
A **fun little web app** that pulls our itinerary straight from a live Google Sheet.  
That means whenever we make changes (time, place, add more hummus stops), the site updates instantly — no reloading from our side needed. 🙌

## 🌈 Features
- **Blend Theme** — white, purple, and blue… because we’re classy like that.  
- **Day Tabs** — pick a day, see what’s happening.  
- **Activity Cards** — each event with icons, descriptions, and links to maps.  
- **Calendar Magic** — add events to your Google Calendar or download `.ics` files.  
- **Countdown** — so you know exactly how many days until the big “I do!” 💍  
- Fully **mobile-friendly** — looks just as good on your phone as on your laptop.
